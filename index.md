# Lightning Network Fun

This site aims to be a fun place for builders to learn about and experiment with Lightning Network technology. We will explore some of the basis of Lightning, like invoices, nodes, and wallet architectures in mobile environments.

We will also look at monetisation strategies like Lightning Service Providers and methods for web services and publishers to integrate Lightning payments.

- Research is ongoing, and can be found under the [Guide](/guide) section
- The general structure of what we plan to do can be found at our [Site Plan](/site-plan) page
